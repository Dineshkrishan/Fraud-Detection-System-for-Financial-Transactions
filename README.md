🔍 Overview
Fraud in financial transactions is a critical concern. This project aims to build a robust system using machine learning to detect fraudulent activities based on transaction patterns, user behavior, and statistical anomalies.

✅ Features
Supervised ML model for fraud detection

Preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines

Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score

Visual analytics for insights and anomaly detection

Scalable for real-time implementation

🧰 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Model: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost

Notebook: Jupyter

Version Control: Git, GitHub

⚙️ How It Works
Load and explore the transaction dataset

Preprocess data (e.g., normalization, encoding, handling imbalance)

Split data into training and testing sets

Train classification models

Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC

Predict fraudulent transactions from new data

📊 Dataset
This project uses a public dataset (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset) containing transaction data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

Columns: Time, Amount, V1–V28 (PCA components), Class (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)

📎 Kaggle Dataset Link

📈 Results
Achieved over 99% accuracy on test data

AUC-ROC score > 0.97

Precision and recall optimized for class imbalance

🔮 Future Work
Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)

Deploy as a REST API for real-time detection

Incorporate additional features like user geolocation or device ID

Real-time alerting system for flagged transactions
